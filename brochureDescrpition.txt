For the first time in career symposium history student-mentor pairings are
formulated using an automated matching algorithm. This algorithm is student
centric meaning that the primary goal of the algoirthm is to pair students
with their highest ranking mentors while ensuring roundtables do not get too
large as this would impede on the mentoring experience. Students are only
paried with mentors they have indicated some level of interest for. 

This algorithm takes into account several factors including student preferences,
student priority (prioritizing students graduating soon) and mentor
populairty and controls for group sizes.
